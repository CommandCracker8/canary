Concept Ideas:
 - Could use a resource pack to do interesting things
   - Hide stuff (beacons, beacon glass)
   - Make book inventory look waaaaay better
   - Make lectern look better
   - Could create a HUD somewhere to show info about running tests (such as how many are running (a progress bar: black=not started, yellow=started, green=passed, red=failed), passes, fails)
 - Dont use a lectern to display book. Can just handle some other block click or command to open the book.
 - Some way to fake a beacon beam perhaps?
